This is a game of Blackjack.

The goal of the game is to end up with the highest total of cards without going over 21.

Both player and dealer are dealt with two cards each.

Subsequently, the player can decide to stand on those cards or pick another card to get a higher total.

The highest total wins. A total over 21 automatically loses and the opponent wins. A tie can occur if both totals are the same or over 21.
